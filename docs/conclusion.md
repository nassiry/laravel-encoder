### Conclusion: Why Choose This Package?
- **URL-Safe Base62**: The default Base62 encoding makes it well-suited for use in URLs, paths, and other web applications, avoiding the need for URL escaping and ensuring human-readable encoded values.
- **Customizable**: With this package, you can easily extend the default Base62 encoding with your own custom encoders (Base58, Base64, etc.) by implementing the `BaseEncoderInterface` and adding it to the factory. This gives you maximum flexibility to tailor the encoding to your needs.
- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The package strikes a balance between simplicity, efficiency, and usability, providing a simple API for encoding and decoding while ensuring that encoded values are short and compact.
